I am a Master's student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) at EPFL, pursuing a minor in Cybersecurity. I received my Bachelor’s degree in EEE from EPFL in 2024.

<!-- My interests lie at the intersection of systems, security, and hardware–software interaction. I enjoy understanding how complex systems behave across multiple layers of abstraction, from low-level electronics and embedded systems to operating systems and secure software design. My work focuses on building, analyzing, and debugging systems with a strong emphasis on robustness, performance, and security. -->

Through academic projects, I have worked on wireless communication systems, decoder design for 6G applications, power electronics, embedded control systems, and secure software architectures.

<!-- I regularly pursue hands-on technical projects in embedded systems, electronics design, and system-level debugging to deepen my practical understanding beyond coursework. -->

Alongside academics, I am particularly interested in responsible and sustainable engineering. Notably energy-efficient hardware and software design, prioritizing repairability over replacement, contributing open-source software and promoting the responsible integration of AI, to respect intellectual property and protect the integrity and authenticity of digital content. I believe that ensuring trustworthy access to information will be one of the defining challenges of our generation.

From this perspective, I co-founded an AI music streaming platform, called [Melødia](https://apps.apple.com/be/app/mel%C3%B8dia/id6749509043), whose goal is to make a clear distinction between human-created music and AI-generated content. Being the only engineer in this early-stage startup, I built the iOS application from the ground up, alongside the backend services and overall infrastructure.

A major focus of my work has been authentication and identity management. One of my main projects outside of academia is the design and implementation of an identity provider (IDP) built around passkeys, combining strong security guarantees with seamless user experience, removing passwords altogether and paving the way for better security online.
