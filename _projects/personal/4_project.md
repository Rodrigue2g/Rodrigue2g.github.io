## Project Overview

Upgrading infrastructure in a countryside house often involves unique challenges where civil engineering meets electrical design. This project involved extending a lighting circuit to a remote garden area, requiring a full end-to-end execution: from manual excavation and concrete channeling to final wiring and integration into a legacy distribution panel.

---

## Infrastructure & Site Preparation

The primary challenge was the "hidden" part of the project: creating a path for the power through established landscaping. 

* **Trenching:** Excavated a path through gravel and soil to a depth sufficient for cable protection.
* **Masonry & Concrete:** To maintain the aesthetic of the terrace, I removed existing stone tiles and used a rotary hammer to channel through the concrete sub-base.
* **Conduit Laying:** Installed flexible conduits to ensure the longevity of the cables against moisture and mechanical stress before re-laying the tiles.

## Electrical Integration

The project required interfacing with the house's legacy distribution system. This phase focused on safe cable management and reliable terminations.

* **Junction & Control:** Installed a new surface-mounted switch and a Schneider Electric junction box.
* **Wiring Standards:** Utilized WAGO lever connectors for secure, maintenance-free connections within the junction box, ensuring better reliability than traditional screw terminals in a high-vibration or temperature-variant environment.
* **The "First" vs "Final" Wiring:** The project involved a transition from a functional "first-fix" to a polished "second-fix," ensuring all conduits were properly capped and dressed.

## Legacy System Analysis

Connecting new hardware to a legacy distribution panel requires a careful assessment of existing capacity and safety. The current panel is a hybrid of different generations of circuit breakers (Merlin Gerin, Hager).

### Future Outlook: Panel Modernization
A planned future project for this estate is the full modernization of this distribution panel. The objective is to replace the aging fuse-based remnants and mixed-brand breakers with a unified system, incorporating:
* **Residual Current Devices (RCDs)** for enhanced protection.
* **AFDD (Arc Fault Detection)** to safeguard the wooden structural elements of the house.
* **Improved Cable Dressing** for better thermal management and ease of maintenance.

## Final Result

The project concluded with the successful installation of a new, switch-controlled lighting branch that blends into the existing environment.
