## Overview

PokerStar-nds is a homebrew Texas Hold'em game developed for the Nintendo DS.

The project involved building a complete poker game loop from scratch, including card shuffling, betting logic, hand evaluation and a touch-driven dual-screen user interface — all running on legacy NDS hardware with strict memory and performance constraints.
